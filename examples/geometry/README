It is recommended to run these examples interactively by loading the
main modules (those mentioned below) into ciaosh.

geometry1      - draws a simple picture during execution
geometry2      - creates an object statically (when loaded in ciaosh)
                 and then draws the picture dynamically (upon execution)
geometry_man   - draws the same picture but objects move
dancing_shapes - another picture with moving objects

It is recommended to run these examples interactively by loading the
main classes (those mentioned below) into ciaosh.

pseudo_stack.pl - A generic class for item storage keeping a history of
                  the item values. This is done via a stack, but
                  the class has the interface of class "generic".

rogue_sorcerer.pl - A very very simple example of interface implementation:
		    a rogue_sorcerer is both a rogue and a sorcerer, thus
		    the class implements both interfaces "rogue" and
		    "sorcerer" (which is to say, inherits from both classes
		    --though an interface has nothing to inherit, except
		    the names of the methods).
